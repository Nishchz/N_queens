# N-Queens Problem using Backtracking ♛

This repository contains a clean Java implementation of the **N-Queens problem**
using the **Backtracking algorithm**.

The goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens
attack each other.

## ✨ Features
- Uses Backtracking technique
- Checks vertical and diagonal safety
- Prints all valid chessboard solutions
- Beginner-friendly Java code
- Works for any value of N

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
**Backtracking**
- Place one queen per row
- Check if the position is safe
- If not safe → backtrack and try next column
